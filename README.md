# Generating_Reports
A web base application to Creating PDF reports using TCPDF PHP class. Used technologies are PHP, HTML, CSS, TCPDF class. 
First download and extract the ZIP file. Then you will get the relevant database and the application. Open your SQL server (eg:- WAMP SERVER) and create a new database called “tut”, then import the database that I provided, database name is “pdf_export”. Then copy and paste the application folder (pdf_report) in your server folder (pathway as eg: C:\wamp\www). Now open your localhost and type : localhost/pdf_report/index.php . This will load your home page. All the files inside the pdf_report file should be in the same folder. Now you can enter any data and check the output. REMEMBER there is a special file called “tcpdf” in the main folder. It should be there as it is, because it contain the PCDF class that need to create a PDF file. This PCDF is open source PHP class that can be downloaded through internet I already uploaded an image to show how it is.
